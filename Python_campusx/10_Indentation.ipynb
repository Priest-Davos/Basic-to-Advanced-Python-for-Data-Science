    "# Indentation in Python\n",
    "Indentation in Python is critical because it is used to define the structure and hierarchy of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces `{}` to delimit blocks of code, Python uses indentation to group statements. Each level of indentation corresponds to a new block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Rules of Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistent Indentation**: All statements within the same block must be indented the same amount. Typically, a single level of indentation is 4 spaces, but it can be any consistent number of spaces or a single tab.\n",
    "2. **Blocks of Code**: Indentation is used to define the body of loops, functions, conditionals, and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: `if-else` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the correct indentation in an `if-else` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "correct_email = \"xxx@gmail.com\"\n",
    "correct_password = \"xxx\"\n",
    "\n",
    "email = input(\"Enter the email: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "if \"@\" in email:\n",
    "    password = input(\"Enter the password: \")\n",
    "    if email == correct_email and password == correct_password:\n",
    "        print(\"Login successful\")\n",
    "    elif email == correct_email and password != correct_password:\n",
    "        print(\"Password is incorrect\")\n",
    "        password = input(\"Enter the password: \")\n",
    "        if password == correct_password:\n",
    "            print(\"Login successful\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"2nd attempt failed\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid credentials\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid email\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points in the Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- The body of the `if \"@\" in email:` statement is indented.\n",
    "- The body of the nested `if email == correct_email and password == correct_password:` statement is further indented.\n",
    "- Similarly, the body of the `elif` and `else` statements are indented to the same level as the original `if`.\n",
    "- Each subsequent block is indented further as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Indentation Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inconsistent Indentation**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if \"@\" in email:\n",
    "        password = input(\"Enter the password: \")\n",
    "      if email == correct_email:  # Incorrect indentation\n",
    "          print(\"Login successful\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Indentation**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if \"@\" in email:\n",
    "    password = input(\"Enter the password: \")  # Missing indentation\n",
    "    if email == correct_email and password == correct_password:\n",
    "        print(\"Login successful\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mixed Tabs and Spaces**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if \"@\" in email:\n",
    "        password = input(\"Enter the password: \")\n",
    "    if email == correct_email and password == correct_password:\n",
    "    \\tprint(\"Login successful\")  # Mixed tabs and spaces (not visible here)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use 4 Spaces per Indent Level**: This is the Python community's standard convention.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Be consistent with your indentation throughout your code.\n",
    "- **Avoid Mixing Tabs and Spaces**: This can lead to errors that are hard to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these rules and guidelines, you ensure that your Python code is correctly structured and easy to read."
