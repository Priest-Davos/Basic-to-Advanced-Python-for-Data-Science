    "In Python, comments are used to annotate the code and make it more readable. They are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect the execution of the program. There are two types of comments in Python: single-line comments and multi-line comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single-Line Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (`#`) and extend to the end of the line. They are typically used to add brief explanations or notes about the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")  # This comment is at the end of a line of code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Line Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common ways to write multi-line comments in Python: using multiple single-line comments or using triple quotes. However, it's important to note that the triple-quote method technically creates a multi-line string, which is not a true comment but can be used as one if it is not assigned to a variable or used in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Multiple Single-Line Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "# that spans multiple lines.\n",
    "# Each line starts with a hash symbol.\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Triple Quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "Triple quotes (either `\"\"\"` or `'''`) are typically used for docstrings, which are string literals used to document modules, classes, functions, or methods. However, they can also be used for multi-line comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "using triple double quotes.\n",
    "It spans multiple lines.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "This is another multi-line comment\n",
    "using triple single quotes.\n",
    "It also spans multiple lines.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are a special kind of comment used to describe the purpose and usage of a module, class, or function. They are placed immediately after the definition and are enclosed in triple quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function adds two numbers and returns the result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    a (int or float): The first number.\n",
    "    b (int or float): The second number.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    int or float: The sum of the two numbers.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the docstring\n",
    "print(add.__doc__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `add` function has a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value. Docstrings can be accessed programmatically using the `__doc__` attribute of the function, class, or module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use comments to explain why, not what**: Comments should explain the reasoning behind a piece of code rather than simply describing what the code does. The code itself should be clear enough to indicate what it does.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Keep comments concise**: Comments should be brief and to the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update comments**: Keep comments up to date with the code they describe. Outdated comments can be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use docstrings for documentation**: Use docstrings to document modules, classes, and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code with Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the math module\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a function to calculate the area of a circle\n",
    "def circle_area(radius):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    radius (float): The radius of the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    float: The area of the circle.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # Calculate the area using the formula: area = Ï€ * radius^2\n",
    "    return math.pi * radius ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage of the circle_area function\n",
    "r = 5\n",
    "print(f\"The area of a circle with radius {r} is {circle_area(r)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the use of single-line comments, a docstring, and clear, self-explanatory code."
