    "In Python, `break`, `continue`, and `pass` are control flow statements that can alter the behavior of loops and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `break` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When `break` is executed, the loop is terminated immediately, and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using `break`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop stops when `i` equals 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `continue` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current iteration of the loop and jumps to the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using `continue`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the loop skips even numbers and prints only odd numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `pass` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pass` statement is a null operation; it does nothing. It's used as a placeholder in loops, functions, classes, or conditionals where syntactically a statement is required, but you don't want to execute any code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using `pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        pass  # Do nothing (placeholder)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "7\n",
    "9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `pass` does nothing and is used where some action could be taken for even numbers but is not implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`break`**: Terminates the nearest enclosing loop immediately.\n",
    "- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration.\n",
    "- **`pass`**: Does nothing and serves as a placeholder where a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these control flow statements, you can manage the behavior of your loops and conditionals to suit your program's logic."

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`continue`**:\n",
    "   - When an order is canceled (`status` is \"canceled\"), the loop skips to the next iteration, avoiding processing the canceled order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`break`**:\n",
    "   - If an item within an order is marked as \"error\", the loop stops processing that particular order and moves on to the next one. The `else` block after the inner loop is not executed in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`pass`**:\n",
    "   - The `pass` statement is a placeholder for future logic. In this context, it does nothing but indicates where additional checks or processing might be added later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how `break`, `continue`, and `pass` can control the flow of a program in a real-life scenario involving processing a list of customer orders."
