    "Scoping in programming refers to the context within which variables and identifiers are accessible. In Python, scope determines where variables can be accessed and modified. Python has a specific model for scoping known as the **LEGB rule**, which stands for **Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in** scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LEGB Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The LEGB rule outlines the order in which Python looks for a variable name:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local (L)**: The innermost scope, which includes local variables defined within a function or a block of code.\n",
    "2. **Enclosing (E)**: The scope of any enclosing functions, which is relevant for nested functions. Variables in the outer (enclosing) function are accessible to inner functions.\n",
    "3. **Global (G)**: The global scope, which includes variables defined at the top level of a module or script.\n",
    "4. **Built-in (B)**: The scope of built-in names, which are part of Python's standard library and always accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Local Scope (L)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variables created inside a function or a block are in the local scope of that function or block.\n",
    "- **Access**: Local variables are only accessible within the function or block where they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    local_var = \"I am local\"  # Local scope\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "print(local_var)  # Error: NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `local_var` is accessible only within `my_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Enclosing Scope (E)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: The scope of any enclosing functions. When you have a nested function, the inner function can access variables from its enclosing (outer) function but not vice versa.\n",
    "- **Access**: Variables from the outer function are accessible within the inner function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    outer_var = \"I am outer\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",
    "        inner_var = \"I am inner\"\n",
    "        print(outer_var)  # Accesses variable from outer function\n",
    "        print(inner_var)  # Accesses variable from inner function\n",
    "    \n",
    "    inner_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `inner_function` can access `outer_var` from `outer_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Global Scope (G)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variables defined at the top level of a module or script, outside any function or class.\n",
    "- **Access**: Global variables can be accessed from any function or block in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_var = \"I am global\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_global():\n",
    "    print(global_var)  # Accesses global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "print_global()  # Output: I am global\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `global_var` is accessible inside `print_global` because it is in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Built-in Scope (B)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: The scope of Python's built-in functions, exceptions, and objects. This scope is automatically available and includes names like `print()`, `len()`, `int`, `str`, etc.\n",
    "- **Access**: Built-in names are always accessible and can be used directly in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(len(\"Hello\"))  # Uses built-in functions print() and len()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `print()` and `len()` are part of Python's built-in scope and are always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Shadowing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Occurs when a variable in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The inner scope's variable shadows or hides the outer scope's variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10  # Global scope\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    x = 5  # Local scope\n",
    "    print(x)  # Outputs: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "print(x)  # Outputs: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `x` in `my_function` shadows the global `x` within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `global` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage**: If you want to modify a global variable from within a function, you must declare it as `global` within the function. This tells Python to use the global variable rather than creating a new local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "def modify_global():\n",
    "    global x\n",
    "    x = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "modify_global()\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `global x` allows the function to modify the global variable `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `nonlocal` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage**: The `nonlocal` keyword is used in nested functions to refer to variables in the nearest enclosing scope that is not the global scope. This allows modification of variables in the enclosing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",
    "        nonlocal x\n",
    "        x = 20\n",
    "    \n",
    "    inner_function()\n",
    "    print(x)  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `nonlocal x` allows `inner_function` to modify `x` in `outer_function`.\n"
