    "### Detailed Variable Referencing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are references (or pointers) to objects in memory. This means that when you assign a value to a variable, you are actually assigning a reference to an object that holds the value. This reference model is fundamental to understanding Python's behavior, particularly in terms of memory management, immutability, and object manipulation.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Memory Allocation and Object References\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a variable and assign a value to it, Python creates an object in memory and the variable references that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Python creates an integer object with the value 42 in memory.\n",
    "- The variable `x` references this integer object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Address\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `id()` function to find the memory address of the object a variable references.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "print(id(x))  # Outputs the memory address of the integer object 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reassigning Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reassign a variable to a new value, the variable reference is updated to point to a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "print(id(x))  # Memory address of 42\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 99\n",
    "print(id(x))  # New memory address for 99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Initially, `x` references the integer object 42.\n",
    "- After reassignment, `x` references a new integer object 99.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable vs Immutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Immutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples. Any operation that modifies an immutable object results in the creation of a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "print(id(x))  # Memory address of 42\n",
    "\n",
    "x = x + 1\n",
    "print(id(x))  # New memory address for 43\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The addition operation creates a new integer object 43.\n",
    "- The variable `x` is updated to reference the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable objects can be changed after they are created. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets. Operations that modify mutable objects do not create new objects but alter the existing object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(id(lst))  # Memory address of the list object\n",
    "\n",
    "lst.append(4)\n",
    "print(id(lst))  # Same memory address, the list object is modified in place\n",
    "print(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `append` operation modifies the list in place.\n",
    "- The memory address of `lst` remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Assignment and References\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assigning Variables to Other Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When you assign one variable to another, both variables reference the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "\n",
    "print(id(a))  # Memory address of the list object\n",
    "print(id(b))  # Same memory address as a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `a` and `b` reference the same list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying the Object through One Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes made through one variable affect the object referenced by all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "\n",
    "a.append(4)\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Modifying `a` also affects `b` because they reference the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Arguments and References\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses \"call by object reference,\" which means function arguments are passed by reference to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_list(lst):\n",
    "    lst.append(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "modify_list(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `modify_list` function modifies `my_list` in place.\n",
    "- Both `lst` (inside the function) and `my_list` reference the same list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses garbage collection to manage memory. When an object has no references, it is considered unreachable and can be garbage collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "\n",
    "del a  # Deletes the reference 'a'\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "del b  # Deletes the reference 'b'\n",
    "# Now the list object has no references and can be garbage collected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- Deleting `a` and `b` makes the list object unreachable.\n",
    "- The garbage collector can reclaim the memory used by the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Detailed Variable Referencing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Create an integer object and assign to x\n",
    "x = 100\n",
    "print(f\"x: {x}, id(x): {id(x)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Create a list object and assign to lst\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(f\"lst: {lst}, id(lst): {id(lst)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Assign lst to lst_copy\n",
    "lst_copy = lst\n",
    "print(f\"lst_copy: {lst_copy}, id(lst_copy): {id(lst_copy)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Modify lst\n",
    "lst.append(4)\n",
    "print(f\"lst: {lst}, id(lst): {id(lst)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"lst_copy: {lst_copy}, id(lst_copy): {id(lst_copy)}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Reassign x\n",
    "x = x + 20\n",
    "print(f\"x: {x}, id(x): {id(x)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x: 100, id(x): 139922108646576\n",
    "lst: [1, 2, 3], id(lst): 139922084867264\n",
    "lst_copy: [1, 2, 3], id(lst_copy): 139922084867264\n",
    "lst: [1, 2, 3, 4], id(lst): 139922084867264\n",
    "lst_copy: [1, 2, 3, 4], id(lst_copy): 139922084867264\n",
    "x: 120, id(x): 139922108646832\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable References**: Variables reference objects in memory.\n",
    "2. **Immutability**: Immutable objects cannot be changed; operations create new objects.\n",
    "3. **Mutability**: Mutable objects can be changed in place.\n",
    "4. **Function Arguments**: Passed by object reference, allowing in-place modifications.\n",
    "5. **Garbage Collection**: Unreachable objects are automatically reclaimed by Python's garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variable referencing in Python is essential for writing efficient, bug-free code and managing memory effectively."
