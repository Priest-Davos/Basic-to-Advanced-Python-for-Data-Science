    "### Mutable and Immutable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutable** and **immutable** are terms used to describe whether an object can be changed after it is created. Understanding these concepts is important in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutable objects** are those that can be modified after creation. This means you can change, add, or remove elements from these objects without creating a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Mutable Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lists**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list[0] = 0      # Changing the first element\n",
    "   my_list.append(4)   # Adding a new element\n",
    "   my_list.pop()       # Removing the last element\n",
    "   print(my_list)      # Output: [0, 2, 3]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dictionaries**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
    "   my_dict[\"a\"] = 0      # Changing the value of key 'a'\n",
    "   my_dict[\"c\"] = 3      # Adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "   del my_dict[\"b\"]      # Removing a key-value pair\n",
    "   print(my_dict)        # Output: {'a': 0, 'c': 3}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sets**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "   my_set.add(4)         # Adding an element\n",
    "   my_set.remove(2)      # Removing an element\n",
    "   print(my_set)         # Output: {1, 3, 4}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Byte Arrays**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_bytearray = bytearray(b\"hello\")\n",
    "   my_bytearray[0] = ord(\"H\")  # Modifying an element\n",
    "   print(my_bytearray)         # Output: bytearray(b'Hello')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **User-Defined Classes/Objects**\n",
    " - Depending on their implementation, objects of user-defined classes can be mutable if they allow changes to their attributes after creation.\n",
    "### Immutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable objects** are those that cannot be changed after creation. Any modification to an immutable object results in a new object being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Immutable Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numbers (integers, floats, complex numbers)**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "   x = x + 1         # Creates a new integer object\n",
    "   print(x)          # Output: 11\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strings**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "   new_string = my_string.upper()  # Creates a new string object\n",
    "   print(new_string)               # Output: \"HELLO\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tuples**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   new_tuple = my_tuple + (4,)     # Creates a new tuple object\n",
    "   print(new_tuple)                # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Frozen Sets**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   # my_frozenset.add(4)           # This would raise an AttributeError\n",
    "   print(my_frozenset)             # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bytes**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_bytes = b\"hello\"\n",
    "   # my_bytes[0] = b\"H\"            # This would raise a TypeError\n",
    "   print(my_bytes)                 # Output: b'hello'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "6. **Booleans**\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Why the Difference Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Mutable objects can be modified in place without creating a new object, which can save memory and improve performance in some cases.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe and can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets because their hash value does not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usability**: Understanding mutability helps in writing predictable and bug-free code, especially in contexts where objects are passed around and modified within functions and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutable Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_list(lst):\n",
    "    lst.append(4)\n",
    "    print(lst)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "modify_list(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Immutable Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_string(s):\n",
    "    s = s + \" world\"\n",
    "    print(s)  # Output: \"hello world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "modify_string(my_string)\n",
    "print(my_string)  # Output: \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and leveraging the concepts of mutable and immutable types can significantly influence the design and performance of your code."
