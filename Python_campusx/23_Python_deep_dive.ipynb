    "#### Immutability and Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable Objects**: Objects that cannot be changed after creation (e.g., integers, strings, tuples). When you perform operations on immutable objects, Python creates a new object and changes the variable reference to point to the new object.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  a = 5\n",
    "  print(id(a))  # Memory address of the integer object 5\n",
    "  \n",
    "  a = a + 1\n",
    "  print(id(a))  # New memory address since a new integer object 6 is created\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable Objects**: Objects that can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets). Modifying a mutable object affects all variables referencing that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  list2 = list1\n",
    "  list1.append(4)\n",
    "  print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "  print(list2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] because list2 references the same object as list1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Call by Object Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, arguments are passed to functions using \"call by object reference\" (or \"call by sharing\"). This means the function receives a reference to the same object, not a copy of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_list(lst):\n",
    "    lst.append(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "modify_list(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `my_list` is modified inside the function because both `my_list` and `lst` reference the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses garbage collection to manage memory automatically. When an object has no more references, it is considered unreachable and can be garbage-collected to free up memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "del a  # 'a' is deleted but 'b' still references the list\n",
    "del b  # Now the list is unreachable and can be garbage-collected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Python optimizes memory usage by reusing existing immutable objects. For example, small integers and interned strings are reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1000\n",
    "y = 1000\n",
    "print(id(x) == id(y))  # True for small integers, might be False for larger integers\n",
    "\n",
    "s1 = \"hello\"\n",
    "s2 = \"hello\"\n",
    "print(id(s1) == id(s2))  # True due to string interning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable Referencing**: Variables in Python reference objects stored in memory, not the actual value.\n",
    "- **Immutability**: Immutable objects create new objects for changes, while mutable objects can be modified in place.\n",
    "- **Call by Object Reference**: Functions receive references to the same object, allowing in-place modifications.\n",
    "- **Garbage Collection**: Python automatically manages memory, freeing up space for unreachable objects.\n",
    "- **Memory Optimization**: Python reuses small integers and interned strings to save memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free Python code, especially when dealing with large data structures and performance-critical applications."
